              Passionate about the endless possibilities of computers, I thrive on continuous learning and innovation. 
              My journey in programming began with a drive to recreate a game I couldn't obtainâ€”a project that sparked 
              a lifelong commitment to mastering technology and creating impactful solutions. With 7 years of experience 
              across Python web development, C# game design, and various other programming realms, I've grown from a 
              beginner coder to a Computer Engineer.

              Currently, I am deepening my expertise through a master's degree focused on Deep Learning, delving into 
              cutting-edge techniques that push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. In my role as a Software 
              Developer at Sovrox, I am shaping digital solutions that blend technical rigor with creative innovation. 
              I'm inspired by the dynamic intersection of technology and creativity and am excited to contribute to a 
              future where we continue to push boundaries and explore new horizons. ðŸš€
